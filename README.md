# ITP1 - EV Battery Component Detection with Deep Learning

**ITP Team 9**  
**Objective**: Automate the detection and segmentation of EV battery components using deep learning for safer, faster disassembly in recycling workflows.

---

### Overview

This project focuses on detecting and segmenting key EV battery components (e.g., bolts, busbars, cables) using semantic and instance segmentation models like **YOLOv8** and **DeepLabV3+**.  
Our pipeline is designed to support integration with **Mech-Mind industrial cameras** and is optimized for future 3D localization (for ITP2).
